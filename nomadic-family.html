    <p>We are here to arrange custom trips for you during your time in Mongolia. Please

    <h2>Countryside Visit with Nomadic Family</h2>

    <p>We are pleased to make available to you a very special opportunity for a home stay 
      with native Mongolians in the steppes outside of UlanBaatar. You will stay in a real ger 
      (not the concrete floor, tourist version often found in tourist camps); observe the nomadic 
      families’ activities; and also have the opportunity to hike and go on horse treks.</p>

     <p>You will be able to experience the real nomadic way of life, yet at the same time, you won’t 
       have to travel far to do it. Rather than spend much of your valuable time riding for days in a jeep 
       or van across the countryside, you will be at your site within an hour or so. The drive there will 
       be on actual roads, so it will be easier and more comfortable than a trek across the country.</p>

    <p>The nomadic family has goats, sheep, and horses, and they milk all three of those animals! You will 
      learn about their daily herding and milking activities, learn about the peoples’ traditional costumes, and
      see how traditional foods are made. You will eat with the family and enjoy the renowned Mongolian
      hospitality!</p>

    <p>Because we are a small company, we can be flexible to suit your needs and desires. We recommend a stay of 
      2 to 3 nights in order to start understanding and feeling the nomadic pace of life. However, we can arrange 
      for your stay to be shorter or longer to fit in with your itinerary.</p>

    <p>We are excited to extend this opportunity to you, as it is an ideal way to achieve our goal of showing you the real
      Mongolian nomadic lifestyle in a way that is convenient and inexpensive for you. Please contact us to plan your
      countryside visit!</p>
