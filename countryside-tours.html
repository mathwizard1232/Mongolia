    <p>We are here to arrange custom trips for you during your stay in Mongolia. Please
      contact us with your questions and needs.</p>

    <center><h2 style="width:250px">Countryside Tours</h2></center>

    <p>After a short stay in Ulanbaatar, it’s time to get out of the city and 
      into the countryside! That is the desire and goal of most of the
      tourists who come to Mongolia.</p>

    <p>Mongolia is a vast, largely undeveloped country and as such, is not easy 
      to get around in. Even roads are few and far between. Often you’ll find 
      yourself traveling across the wild country simply following tracks — 
      or sometimes not even that! Helps that we are used to, such as service
      stations and mechanics, are rare in this land. To navigate this country, 
      you will need the help of people who know it!</p>

    <p>Wherever your travel goals are in Mongolia — to the desert land of the 
      Gobi in the south, the high mountain Khazak region in the west, or the 
      beautiful Khovsgol Nuur (Lake Hovsgol) set in the Siberian taiga of the north 
      — we can take you there and at the same time, see to it that you 
      experience the ‘real’ Mongolia and its people and learn about
      our history.</p>

    <center><h3 style="width:250px">Closer to Ulanbaatar</h3></center>

    <p>Distances are great in Mongolia and are not traveled over as quickly as 
      in the more developed parts of the world. This is part of the excitement of 
      visiting Mongolia; however, it also adds to the difficulty of the visit!
      Travel over long distances can be exhausting, expensive, and require more 
      time than many visitors have at their disposal.</p>
    <p>However, there is an answer! The steppes and mountains close to
      Ulanbaatar are beautiful places to visit and they give you as true an
      exposure to the real nomadic way of life as a visit to the more far-flung
      regions of the country. Unlike in many areas of the world, when you leave 
      the city (UB), you find yourself truly in the countryside. No urban sprawl
      extending for miles (or kilometers) here!</p>

    <p>We can help you arrange visits to the beautiful nearby alpine area of 
      Terelj where, if you’d like, you can go hiking, rock climbing, horse riding, 
      and rafting.</p>
