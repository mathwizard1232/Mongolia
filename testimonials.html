    <img src="img/mom.jpg" class="align-left">  
  <p>I visited Mongolia as an independent traveler in the summer of 2009 and while
    there I met Tsoogii at a nature reserve in the Gobi. We became friends
    immediately! I got to know her husband and children and stayed with them in Ulanbaatar.
    In addition, I was privileged to travel with her brother, Tsende, to their home village
    and to meet their parents as well as many members of the extended family. I have also been
    honored to meet members of Boroo’s family. These people are hospitable, interesting
    and kind. Both families are involved in the couple’s new venture, TTNTours.</p>

  <p>When I heard that Tsoogii and Boroo wanted to open their own tour business, I was
    very pleased and wanted to help in any way that I could. I offered to help them get a website set up
    and to be an American contact person.</p>

  <p>I was happy to do this because I know what kind of people Tsoogii and Boroo
    are. I would not hesitate to recommend them to any of my friends or family members because I know that they can be
    trusted.They truly desire to use their skills and background to help visitors learn about the real
    Mongolia.They are also caring, trustworthy people that you can feel safe entrusting yourself to.</p>

  <p>Traveling in Mongolia is very different from almost anywhere else in the world. It has an interesting mix of new and very
    old.On the one hand, in Ulanbaatar you can see some of the newest and most expensive vehicles made. On the
    other hand, you can go to the countryside and observe people living in pretty much the same way that they
    have for millennia.</p>

  <p>However, it is not easy to access this culture. You can’t simply grab a roadmap, rent a car, and hit the road as you
    can in many Western countries. It is imperative to have some type of guide in order to visit and understand this
    place. </p>

  <p>Travel and tourism in Mongolia are much more personal than in many other
    places: most of the country doesn’t even have hotels; it is impossible for
    large tourist buses to navigate across the land. Since there isn’t the typical tourism
    infrastructure in place, interactions happen at a more personal level. When traveling cross country, for example,
    one is reliant upon the kindness of the nomads that one encounters. This is
    part of the charm of the area, but again, also something that makes travel
    here more difficult.</p>

  <p>If you are seeking a personal and up close view of this amazing land and culture, I
    highly recommend that you contact Tsoogii. She understands the needs of tourists, she speaks English!, and she
    knows how to arrange travel. In this sometimes bewildering and confusing land, she will be someone that you can
    absolutely trust.</p>
